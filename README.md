The **NMEA-GPS Emulator** is a simple script that emulates a GPS receiver (simulates unit's movement). Data generated by the script are sent to clients in **NMEA 0183** format. 
This script can be useful for testing applications or systems that require some unit's GPS position data.

The **NMEA-GPS Emulator** script can be used in one of the following operating modes:
- NMEA TCP Stream (sends TCP packets to the specified client),
- NMEA UDP Stream (sends UDP packets to the specified client),
- NMEA TCP Server (the server waits for client connections, then sends TCP packets to the connected clients - max 10 connections)
- NMEA Serial (transmit serial data on specified RS port).
***
## Features
- The script allows the user to enter the following data:
  - unit's position;
  - unit's speed;
  - unit's course;
  - operating mode selection (NMEA Serial, NMEA TCP Server, NMEA TCP or UDP Stream);
  - IP address & port pair or serial port name.
- After the NMEA data transmission has started, the script allows the user to interactively change the speed and course of the unit.
- Generated NMEA sentences are resent to the selected clients periodically (every second). Each time a data with NMEA sentences is sent, the position of the unit is updated based on its speed and course.

List of NMEA sentences generated by **NMEA-GPS Emulator** script:
```
GPGGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data
GPGLL - Position data: position fix, time of position fix, and status
GPRMC - Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data
GPGSA - GPS DOP and active satellites
GPGSV - GPS Satellites in view
GPHDT - True Heading
GPVTG - Track made good and ground speed
GPZDA - Date & Time
```
Output example:
```

## Getting Started

Below instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Requirements

Python third party packages:
* [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/)
* [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
* [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)

In order to use **NMEA Serial** mode correctly, it is necessary to use dedicated serial **null modem** cable.

On Linux systems you will probably need to change the permissions for the device matching your serial port before running the script.
```bash
# Example command for /dev/ttyUSB0 device
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Installation with venv
The script can be build and run locally with virtualenv tool. Run following commands in order to create virtual environment and install the required packages.
```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the script
You can start the script using the following command:
```bash
(venv) $ python main.py
```
After starting the script correctly, the following prompt should appear in the OS console:

```bash
..####...#####....####...........######..##...##..##..##..##.......####...######...####...#####..
.##......##..##..##..............##......###.###..##..##..##......##..##....##....##..##..##..##.

.................................................................................................
        
### Choose emulator option: ###
1 - NMEA Serial
2 - NMEA TCP Server
3 - NMEA TCP or UDP Stream
4 - Quit
